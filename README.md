### Brezza colour scheme for Vim
Brezza is a colour scheme for Vim.
It is the first time to make a colour scheme myself this time.

Only 256-colour terminals and dark background theme are supported for the present.

Some of colours may be changed without notice.

_Inspired by Bianchi and Miku Hatsune._
